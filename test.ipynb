       "'1. The table below gives current information on the interest rates for two two-year and two eight-year maturity investments. The table also gives the maturity, liquidity, and default risk characteristics of a new investment possibility (Invest- ment 3). All investments promise only a single payment (a payment at maturity). Assume that premiums relating to inflation, liquidity, and default risk are con- stant across all time horizons. Investment Maturity (in Years) Liquidity Default Risk Interest Rate (%) 1 2 High Low 2.0 2 2 Low Low 2.5 3 7 Low Low r3 4 8 High Low 4.0 5 8 Low High 6.5 Based on the information in the above table, address the following: A. Explain the difference between the interest rates on Investment 1 and Investment 2. B. Estimate the default risk premium. C. Calculate upper and lower limits for the interest rate on Investment 3, r3. 2. The nominal risk-free rate is best described as the sum of the real risk-free rate and a premium for: A. maturity. B. liquidity. C. expected inflation. 3.

If the stated annual rate is 2.50% compounded weekly, the deposit needed today is closest to: A. £97,500. B. £97,532. C. £97,561. 13. A client can choose between receiving 10 annual $100,000 retirement payments, starting one year from today, or receiving a lump sum today. Knowing that he can invest at a rate of 5 percent annually, he has decided to take the lump sum. What lump sum today will be equivalent to the future annual payments? 14. You are considering investing in two different instruments. The first instrument will pay nothing for three years, but then it will pay $20,000 per year for four years.
