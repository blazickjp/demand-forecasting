            "description": "Doug Abitbol is a portfolio manager for Polyi Investments, a hedge fund that trades in the United States. Abitbol looks at economists\u2019 inflation forecasts and would like to examine the relationship between the US Consumer Price Index (US CPI) consensus forecast and the actual US CPI using regression analysis. Olabudo estimates regression coefficients to test whether the consensus forecast is unbiased. If the consensus forecasts are unbiased, the intercept should be 0.0 and the slope will be equal to 1.0. Regression results are presented in Exhibit 1. Additionally, Olabudo calculates the 95% prediction interval of the actual CPI using a US CPI consensus forecast of 2.8.",
