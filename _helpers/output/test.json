In some cases, we assume \na particular value for the interest rate; in other cases, the interest rate will be the \nunknown quantity we seek to determine. Before turning to the mechanics of time \nvalue of money problems, we must illustrate the underlying economic concepts. In \nthis section, we briefly explain the meaning and interpretation of interest rates.\nTime value of money concerns equivalence relationships between cash flows \noccurring on different dates. The idea of equivalence relationships is relatively simple. \nConsider the following exchange: You pay $10,000 today and in return receive $9,500 \ntoday. Would you accept this arrangement? Not likely. But what if you received the \n$9,500 today and paid the $10,000 one year from now? Can these amounts be considered \nequivalent? Possibly, because a payment of $10,000 a year from now would probably \nbe worth less to you than a payment of $10,000 today. It would be fair, therefore, \nto discount the $10,000 received in one year; that is, to cut its value based on how \nmuch time passes before the money is paid. An interest rate, denoted r, is a rate of \nreturn that reflects the relationship between differently dated cash flows. If $9,500 \ntoday and $10,000 in one year are equivalent in value, then $10,000 - $9,500 = $500 \nis the required compensation for receiving $10,000 in one year rather than now. The \ninterest rate\u2014the required compensation stated as a rate of return\u2014is $500/$9,500 \n= 0.0526 or 5.26 percent.\nInterest rates can be thought of in three ways. First, they can be considered required \nrates of return\u2014that is, the minimum rate of return an investor must receive in order \nto accept the investment. Second, interest rates can be considered discount rates. In \nthe example above, 5.26 percent is that rate at which we discounted the $10,000 future \namount to find its value today. Thus, we use the terms \u201cinterest rate\u201d and \u201cdiscount \nrate\u201d almost interchangeably. Third, interest rates can be considered opportunity costs. \n1 Examples in this reading and other readings in quantitative methods at Level I were updated in 2018 by \nProfessor Sanjiv Sabherwal of the University of Texas, Arlington.\n2\n\nInterest Rates\n5\nAn opportunity cost is the value that investors forgo by choosing a particular course \nof action. In the example, if the party who supplied $9,500 had instead decided to \nspend it today, he would have forgone earning 5.26 percent on the money. So we can \nview 5.26 percent as the opportunity cost of current consumption.\nEconomics tells us that interest rates are set in the marketplace by the forces of sup-\nply and demand, where investors are suppliers of funds and borrowers are demanders \nof funds. Taking the perspective of investors in analyzing market-determined interest \nrates, we can view an interest rate r as being composed of a real risk-free interest rate \nplus a set of four premiums that are required returns or compensation for bearing \ndistinct types of risk:\n \nr = Real risk-free interest rate + Inflation premium + Default risk premium + \nLiquidity premium + Maturity premium\n\u25a0 \nThe real risk-free interest rate is the single-period interest rate for a com-\npletely risk-free security if no inflation were expected. In economic theory, \nthe real risk-free rate reflects the time preferences of individuals for current \nversus future real consumption.\n\u25a0 \nThe inflation premium compensates investors for expected inflation and \nreflects the average inflation rate expected over the maturity of the debt. \nInflation reduces the purchasing power of a unit of currency\u2014the amount \nof goods and services one can buy with it. The sum of the real risk-free \ninterest rate and the inflation premium is the nominal risk-free interest \nrate.2 Many countries have governmental short-term debt whose interest \nrate can be considered to represent the nominal risk-free interest rate in that \ncountry. The interest rate on a 90-day US Treasury bill (T-bill), for example, \nrepresents the nominal risk-free interest rate over that time horizon.3 US \nT-bills can be bought and sold in large quantities with minimal transaction \ncosts and are backed by the full faith and credit of the US government.\n\u25a0 \nThe default risk premium compensates investors for the possibility that the \nborrower will fail to make a promised payment at the contracted time and in \nthe contracted amount.\n\u25a0 \nThe liquidity premium compensates investors for the risk of loss relative \nto an investment\u2019s fair value if the investment needs to be converted to cash \nquickly. US T-bills, for example, do not bear a liquidity premium because \nlarge amounts can be bought and sold without affecting their market price. \nMany bonds of small issuers, by contrast, trade infrequently after they are \nissued; the interest rate on such bonds includes a liquidity premium reflect-\ning the relatively high costs (including the impact on price) of selling a \nposition.\n\u25a0 \nThe maturity premium compensates investors for the increased sensitivity \nof the market value of debt to a change in market interest rates as maturity \nis extended, in general (holding all else equal). The difference between the \n2 Technically, 1 plus the nominal rate equals the product of 1 plus the real rate and 1 plus the inflation rate. \nAs a quick approximation, however, the nominal rate is equal to the real rate plus an inflation premium. \nIn this discussion we focus on approximate additive relationships to highlight the underlying concepts.\n3 Other developed countries issue securities similar to US Treasury bills. The French government issues \nBTFs or negotiable fixed-rate discount Treasury bills (Bons du Tr\u00e9sor \u00e0taux fixe et \u00e0 int\u00e9r\u00eats pr\u00e9compt\u00e9s) \nwith maturities of up to one year. The Japanese government issues a short-term Treasury bill with matur-\nities of 6 and 12 months. The German government issues at discount both Treasury financing paper \n(Finanzierungssch\u00e4tze des Bundes or, for short, Sch\u00e4tze) and Treasury discount paper (Bubills) with \nmaturities up to 24 months. In the United Kingdom, the British government issues gilt-edged Treasury \nbills with maturities ranging from 1 to 364 days. The Canadian government bond market is closely related \nto the US market; Canadian Treasury bills have maturities of 3, 6, and 12 months.\n\nLearning Module 1 \nThe Time Value of Money\n6\ninterest rate on longer-maturity, liquid Treasury debt and that on short-term \nTreasury debt reflects a positive maturity premium for the longer-term debt \n(and possibly different inflation premiums as well).\nUsing this insight into the economic meaning of interest rates, we now turn to a \ndiscussion of solving time value of money problems, starting with the future value \nof a single cash flow.\n",

We describe the relationship between an initial investment or present \nvalue (PV), which earns a rate of return (the interest rate per period) denoted as r, \nand its future value (FV), which will be received N years or periods from today.\nThe following example illustrates this concept. Suppose you invest $100 (PV = \n$100) in an interest-bearing bank account paying 5 percent annually. At the end of \nthe first year, you will have the $100 plus the interest earned, 0.05 \u00d7 $100 = $5, for a \ntotal of $105. To formalize this one-period example, we define the following terms:\n \nPV = present value of the investment\n FVN = future value of the investment N periods from today\n \nr = rate of interest per period\nFor N = 1, the expression for the future value of amount PV is\n FV1 = PV(1 + r)   \n(1)\nFor this example, we calculate the future value one year from today as FV1 = $100(1.05) \n= $105.\nNow suppose you decide to invest the initial $100 for two years with interest \nearned and credited to your account annually (annual compounding). At the end of \nthe first year (the beginning of the second year), your account will have $105, which \nyou will leave in the bank for another year. Thus, with a beginning amount of $105 \n(PV = $105), the amount at the end of the second year will be $105(1.05) = $110.25. \nNote that the $5.25 interest earned during the second year is 5 percent of the amount \ninvested at the beginning of Year 2.\nAnother way to understand this example is to note that the amount invested at \nthe beginning of Year 2 is composed of the original $100 that you invested plus the \n$5 interest earned during the first year. During the second year, the original principal \nagain earns interest, as does the interest that was earned during Year 1. You can see \nhow the original investment grows:\nOriginal investment\n$100.00\nInterest for the first year ($100 \u00d7 0.05)\n5.00\nInterest for the second year based on original investment ($100 \u00d7 0.05)\n5.00\n3\n\nFuture Value of a Single Cash Flow\n7\nInterest for the second year based on interest earned in the first year (0.05 \u00d7 \n$5.00 interest on interest)\n0.25\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Total\n$110.25\nThe $5 interest that you earned each period on the $100 original investment is known \nas simple interest (the interest rate times the principal). Principal is the amount of \nfunds originally invested. During the two-year period, you earn $10 of simple interest. \nThe extra $0.25 that you have at the end of Year 2 is the interest you earned on the \nYear 1 interest of $5 that you reinvested.\nThe interest earned on interest provides the first glimpse of the phenomenon \nknown as compounding. Although the interest earned on the initial investment is \nimportant, for a given interest rate it is fixed in size from period to period. The com-\npounded interest earned on reinvested interest is a far more powerful force because, \nfor a given interest rate, it grows in size each period. The importance of compounding \nincreases with the magnitude of the interest rate. For example, $100 invested today \nwould be worth about $13,150 after 100 years if compounded annually at 5 percent, \nbut worth more than $20 million if compounded annually over the same time period \nat a rate of 13 percent.\nTo verify the $20 million figure, we need a general formula to handle compounding \nfor any number of periods. The following general formula relates the present value of \nan initial investment to its future value after N periods:\n FVN = PV(1 + r)N   \n(2)\nwhere r is the stated interest rate per period and N is the number of compounding \nperiods. In the bank example, FV2 = $100(1 + 0.05)2 = $110.25. In the 13 percent \ninvestment example, FV100 = $100(1.13)100 = $20,316,287.42.\nThe most important point to remember about using the future value equation is \nthat the stated interest rate, r, and the number of compounding periods, N, must be \ncompatible. Both variables must be defined in the same time units. For example, if \nN is stated in months, then r should be the one-month interest rate, unannualized.\nA time line helps us to keep track of the compatibility of time units and the interest \nrate per time period. In the time line, we use the time index t to represent a point in \ntime a stated number of periods from today. Thus the present value is the amount \navailable for investment today, indexed as t = 0. We can now refer to a time N periods \nfrom today as t = N. The time line in Exhibit 1 shows this relationship.\nExhibit 1: The Relationship between an Initial Investment, PV, and Its Future \nValue, FV\n0\n1\n 2\n 3\n...\nN \u2013 1\nN\nPV\nFVN = PV(1 + r)N\nIn Exhibit 1, we have positioned the initial investment, PV, at t = 0. Using Equation \n2, we move the present value, PV, forward to t = N by the factor (1 + r)N. This factor \nis called a future value factor. We denote the future value on the time line as FV and \n\nLearning Module 1 \nThe Time Value of Money\n8\nposition it at t = N. Suppose the future value is to be received exactly 10 periods from \ntoday\u2019s date (N = 10). The present value, PV, and the future value, FV, are separated \nin time through the factor (1 + r)10.\nThe fact that the present value and the future value are separated in time has \nimportant consequences:\n\u25a0 \nWe can add amounts of money only if they are indexed at the same point in \ntime.\n\u25a0 \nFor a given interest rate, the future value increases with the number of \nperiods.\n\u25a0 \nFor a given number of periods, the future value increases with the interest \nrate.\nTo better understand these concepts, consider three examples that illustrate how \nto apply the future value formula.\nEXAMPLE 1\nThe Future Value of a Lump Sum with Interim Cash \nReinvested at the Same Rate\n1. You are the lucky winner of your state\u2019s lottery of $5 million after taxes. \nYou invest your winnings in a five-year certificate of deposit (CD) at a local \nfinancial institution. The CD promises to pay 7 percent per year compound-\ned annually. This institution also lets you reinvest the interest at that rate for \nthe duration of the CD. How much will you have at the end of five years if \nyour money remains invested at 7 percent for five years with no withdraw-\nals?\nSolution: \nTo solve this problem, compute the future value of the $5 million investment \nusing the following values in Equation 2:\n \nPV = $5, 000, 000\n  \n \nr = 7 %  = 0.07\n  \n \nN = 5\n  \n FV N = PV  ( 1 + r ) N   \n \n= $5,000,000  ( 1.07 ) 5 \n  \n \n= $5,000,000  ( 1.402552 )  \n  \n \n \n= $7,012,758.65\n \n \nAt the end of five years, you will have $7,012,758.65 if your money remains \ninvested at 7 percent with no withdrawals.\nIn this and most examples in this reading, note that the factors are reported at six \ndecimal places but the calculations may actually reflect greater precision. For exam-\nple, the reported 1.402552 has been rounded up from 1.40255173 (the calculation is \nactually carried out with more than eight decimal places of precision by the calculator \nor spreadsheet). Our final result reflects the higher number of decimal places carried \nby the calculator or spreadsheet.4\n4 We could also solve time value of money problems using tables of interest rate factors. Solutions using \ntabled values of interest rate factors are generally less accurate than solutions obtained using calculators \nor spreadsheets, so practitioners prefer calculators or spreadsheets.\n\nFuture Value of a Single Cash Flow\n9\nEXAMPLE 2\nThe Future Value of a Lump Sum with No Interim Cash\n1. An institution offers you the following terms for a contract: For an invest-\nment of \u00a52,500,000,  the institution promises to pay you a lump sum six \nyears from now at an 8 percent annual interest rate. What future amount \ncan you expect?\nSolution: \nUse the following data in Equation 2 to find the future value:\n \nPV = \u00a52, 500, 000\n  \n \nr = 8 %  = 0.08\n  \n \nN = 6\n  \n FV N = PV  ( 1 + r ) N   \n \n= \u00a52, 500, 000  ( 1.08 ) 6 \n  \n \n= \u00a52, 500, 000  ( 1.586874 )  \n  \n \n \n= \u00a53, 967, 186\n \n \nYou can expect to receive \u00a53,967,186 six years from now.\nOur third example is a more complicated future value problem that illustrates the \nimportance of keeping track of actual calendar time.\nEXAMPLE 3\nThe Future Value of a Lump Sum\n1. A pension fund manager estimates that his corporate sponsor will make \na $10 million contribution five years from now. The rate of return on plan \nassets has been estimated at 9 percent per year. The pension fund manager \nwants to calculate the future value of this contribution 15 years from now, \nwhich is the date at which the funds will be distributed to retirees. What is \nthat future value?\nSolution:\nBy positioning the initial investment, PV, at t = 5, we can calculate the future \nvalue of the contribution using the following data in Equation 2:\n \nPV = $10 million\n  \n \nr = 9 %  = 0.09\n  \n \nN = 10\n  \n FV N = PV  ( 1 + r ) N   \n \n= $10,000,000  ( 1.09 ) 10 \n  \n \n= $10,000,000  ( 2.367364 )  \n  \n \n \n= $23,673,636.75\n \n \nThis problem looks much like the previous two, but it differs in one im-\nportant respect: its timing. From the standpoint of today (t = 0), the future \namount of $23,673,636.75 is 15 years into the future. Although the future \nvalue is 10 years from its present value, the present value of $10 million will \nnot be received for another five years.\n \n\nLearning Module 1 \nThe Time Value of Money\n10\nExhibit 2: The Future Value of a Lump Sum, Initial Investment Not at \nt = 0\n \nAs Exhibit 2 shows, we have followed the convention of indexing today \nas t = 0 and indexing subsequent times by adding 1 for each period. The \nadditional contribution of $10 million is to be received in five years, so it is \nindexed as t = 5 and appears as such in the figure. The future value of the \ninvestment in 10 years is then indexed at t = 15; that is, 10 years following \nthe receipt of the $10 million contribution at t = 5. Time lines like this one \ncan be extremely useful when dealing with more-complicated problems, \nespecially those involving more than one cash flow.\nIn a later section of this reading, we will discuss how to calculate the value today \nof the $10 million to be received five years from now. For the moment, we can use \nEquation 2. Suppose the pension fund manager in Example 3 above were to receive \n$6,499,313.86 today from the corporate sponsor. How much will that sum be worth \nat the end of five years? How much will it be worth at the end of 15 years?\n \nPV = $6,499,313.86\n  \n \nr = 9 %  = 0.09\n  \n \nN = 5\n  \n FV N = PV  ( 1 + r ) N   \n \n= $6,499,313.86  ( 1.09 ) 5 \n  \n \n= $6,499,313.86  ( 1.538624 )  \n  \n \n \n= $10,000,000 at the five-year mark\n  \nand\n \nPV = $6,499,313.86\n  \n \nr = 9 %  = 0.09\n  \n \nN = 15\n  \n FV N = PV  ( 1 + r ) N   \n \n= $6,499,313.86  ( 1.09 ) 15 \n  \n \n \n= $6,499,313.86  ( 3.642482 )  \n  \n \n \n= $23,673,636.74 at the 15-year mark\n  \nThese results show that today\u2019s present value of about $6.5 million becomes $10 \nmillion after five years and $23.67 million after 15 years.\n",

For \ninstance, many banks offer a monthly interest rate that compounds 12 times a year. \nIn such an arrangement, they pay interest on interest every month. Rather than quote \nthe periodic monthly interest rate, financial institutions often quote an annual interest \nrate that we refer to as the stated annual interest rate or quoted interest rate. We \ndenote the stated annual interest rate by rs. For instance, your bank might state that \na particular CD pays 8 percent compounded monthly. The stated annual interest rate \nequals the monthly interest rate multiplied by 12. In this example, the monthly interest \nrate is 0.08/12 = 0.0067 or 0.67 percent.5 This rate is strictly a quoting convention \nbecause (1 + 0.0067)12 = 1.083, not 1.08; the term (1 + rs) is not meant to be a future \nvalue factor when compounding is more frequent than annual.\nWith more than one compounding period per year, the future value formula can \nbe expressed as\n FV N = PV  ( 1 +  \n r s  \n_ \nm  ) \nmN\n \n(3)\nwhere rs is the stated annual interest rate, m is the number of compounding \nperiods per year, and N now stands for the number of years. Note the compatibility \nhere between the interest rate used, rs/m, and the number of compounding periods, \nmN. The periodic rate, rs/m, is the stated annual interest rate divided by the number \nof compounding periods per year. The number of compounding periods, mN, is the \nnumber of compounding periods in one year multiplied by the number of years. The \nperiodic rate, rs/m, and the number of compounding periods, mN, must be compatible.\nEXAMPLE 4\nThe Future Value of a Lump Sum with Quarterly \nCompounding\n1.

The \ncurrent interest rate on GICs is 6 percent a year, compounded monthly. \nHow much should she invest today in the GIC?\nSolution:\nUse Equation 9 to find the required present value:\n \n FV N = C$5,000,000\n  \n \n r s = 6 %  = 0.06\n  \n \nm = 12\n  \n r s \u200a/\u200am = 0.06\u200a/\u200a12 = 0.005\n  \n \n \nN = 10\n  \nmN = 12  ( 10 )  = 120  \n \nPV =  FV N  ( 1 +  \n r s  \n_ \nm  ) \n-mN\n \n  \n \n \n= C$5,000,000  ( 1.005 ) -120 \n  \n \n \n= C$5,000,000  ( 0.549633 )  \n  \n \n \n= C$2,748,163.67\n \n \nIn applying Equation 9, we use the periodic rate (in this case, the monthly \nrate) and the appropriate number of periods with monthly compounding (in \nthis case, 10 years of monthly compounding, or 120 periods).\n\nPresent Value of a Series of Equal and Unequal Cash Flows\n21\nPRESENT VALUE OF A SERIES OF EQUAL AND \nUNEQUAL CASH FLOWS\ncalculate and interpret the future value (FV) and present value (PV) \nof a single sum of money, an ordinary annuity, an annuity due, a \nperpetuity (PV only), and a series of unequal cash flows\ndemonstrate the use of a time line in modeling and solving time \nvalue of money problems\nMany applications in investment management involve assets that offer a series of \ncash flows over time.

Suppose you are considering purchasing a financial asset that promises to \npay EUR1,000 per year for five years, with the first payment one year from now. \nThe required rate of return is 12 percent per year. How much should you pay \nfor this asset?\nSolution:\nTo find the value of the financial asset, use the formula for the present value \nof an ordinary annuity given in Equation 11 with the following data:\nA = EUR1,000\nr = 12% = 0.12\nN = 5\nPV =  A  [ \n1 -  \n1 \n_ \n ( 1 + r ) N    \n_ \nr \n ]   \n = EUR1,000  [ \n1 -  \n1 \n_ \n ( 1.12 ) 5    \n_ \n0.12 \n ]   \n = EUR1,000(3.604776)\n = EUR3,604.78\nThe series of cash flows of EUR1,000 per year for five years is currently worth \nEUR3,604.78 when discounted at 12 percent.\nKeeping track of the actual calendar time brings us to a specific type of annuity \nwith level payments: the annuity due. An annuity due has its first payment occurring \ntoday (t = 0). In total, the annuity due will make N payments. Exhibit 8 presents the \ntime line for an annuity due that makes four payments of $100.\nExhibit 8: An Annuity Due of $100 per Period\n|\n|\n|\n|\n0\n1\n2\n3\n$100\n$100\n$100\n$100\nAs Exhibit 8 shows, we can view the four-period annuity due as the sum of two parts: \na $100 lump sum today and an ordinary annuity of $100 per period for three periods. \nAt a 12 percent discount rate, the four $100 cash flows in this annuity due example \nwill be worth $340.18.7\nExpressing the value of the future series of cash flows in today\u2019s dollars gives us a \nconvenient way of comparing annuities. The next example illustrates this approach.\n7 There is an alternative way to calculate the present value of an annuity due. Compared to an ordinary \nannuity, the payments in an annuity due are each discounted one less period. Therefore, we can modify \nEquation 11 to handle annuities due by multiplying the right-hand side of the equation by (1 + r):\n PV  ( Annuity\u00a0due )  = A  {  [ 1 -  ( 1 + r ) -N ]  / r }   ( 1 + r )   \n\nPresent Value of a Series of Equal and Unequal Cash Flows\n23\nEXAMPLE 12\nAn Annuity Due as the Present Value of an Immediate \nCash Flow Plus an Ordinary Annuity\n1. You are retiring today and must choose to take your retirement benefits \neither as a lump sum or as an annuity. Your company\u2019s benefits officer pres-\nents you with two alternatives: an immediate lump sum of $2 million or an \nannuity with 20 payments of $200,000 a year with the first payment starting \ntoday. The interest rate at your bank is 7 percent per year compounded an-\nnually. Which option has the greater present value? (Ignore any tax differ-\nences between the two options.)\nSolution:\nTo compare the two options, find the present value of each at time t = 0 and \nchoose the one with the larger value. The first option\u2019s present value is $2 \nmillion, already expressed in today\u2019s dollars. The second option is an annuity \ndue. Because the first payment occurs at t = 0, you can separate the annuity \nbenefits into two pieces: an immediate $200,000 to be paid today (t = 0) and \nan ordinary annuity of $200,000 per year for 19 years. To value this option, \nyou need to find the present value of the ordinary annuity using Equation 11 \nand then add $200,000 to it.\n \nA = $200,000\n  \n \nN = 19\n  \nr = 7% = 0.07\n  \n \nPV = A  [ \n1 -  \n1 \n_ \n ( 1 + r ) N    \n_ \nr \n ]  \n  \n \n= $200,000  [ \n1 -  \n1 \n_ \n ( 1.07 ) 19    \n_ \n0.07 \n ]  \n  \n \n \n= $200,000  ( 10.335595 )  \n  \n \n= $2,067,119.05\n \n \nThe 19 payments of $200,000 have a present value of $2,067,119.05. Adding \nthe initial payment of $200,000 to $2,067,119.05, we find that the total value \nof the annuity option is $2,267,119.05. The present value of the annuity is \ngreater than the lump sum alternative of $2 million.\nWe now look at another example reiterating the equivalence of present and future \nvalues.\nEXAMPLE 13\nThe Projected Present Value of an Ordinary Annuity\n1. A German pension fund manager anticipates that benefits of EUR1 million per \nyear must be paid to retirees. Retirements will not occur until 10 years from \nnow at time t = 10. Once benefits begin to be paid, they will extend until \nt = 39 for a total of 30 payments. What is the present value of the pension \n\nLearning Module 1 \nThe Time Value of Money\n24\nliability if the appropriate annual discount rate for plan liabilities is 5 percent \ncompounded annually?\nSolution:\nThis problem involves an annuity with the first payment at t = 10. From the \nperspective of t = 9, we have an ordinary annuity with 30 payments. We can \ncompute the present value of this annuity with Equation 11 and then look at \nit on a time line.\nA = EUR1,000,000\nr = 5% = 0.05\nN = 30\nPV =  A  [ \n1 -  \n1 \n_ \n ( 1 + r ) N    \n_ \nr \n ]   \n = EUR1,000,000  [ \n1 -  \n1 \n_ \n ( 1.05 ) 30    \n_ \n0.05 \n ]   \n = EUR1,000,000(15.372451)\n = EUR15,372,451.03\n \nExhibit 9: The Present Value of an Ordinary Annuity with First \nPayment at Time t = 10 (in Millions) \n \n0 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9\n10\n11           12 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 39\n1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \n1\n1\n1\nOn the time line, we have shown the pension payments of EUR1 million ex-\ntending from t = 10 to t = 39. The bracket and arrow indicate the process of \nfinding the present value of the annuity, discounted back to t = 9. The pres-\nent value of the pension benefits as of t = 9 is EUR15,372,451.03. The problem is \nto find the present value today (at t = 0).\nNow we can rely on the equivalence of present value and future value. As \nExhibit 9 shows, we can view the amount at t = 9 as a future value from the \nvantage point of t = 0. We compute the present value of the amount at t = 9 \nas follows:\nFVN = EUR15,372,451.03 (the present value at t = 9)\nN = 9\nr = 5% = 0.05\nPV = FVN(1 + r)\u2013N\n = EUR15,372,451.03(1.05)\u20139\n = EUR15,372,451.03(0.644609)\n = EUR9,909,219.00\nThe present value of the pension liability is EUR9,909,219.00.\n\nPresent Value of a Series of Equal and Unequal Cash Flows\n25\nExample 13 illustrates three procedures emphasized in this reading:\n\u25a0 \nfinding the present or future value of any cash flow series;\n\u25a0 \nrecognizing the equivalence of present value and appropriately discounted \nfuture value; and\n\u25a0 \nkeeping track of the actual calendar time in a problem involving the time \nvalue of money.\nThe Present Value of a Series of Unequal Cash Flows\nWhen we have unequal cash flows, we must first find the present value of each indi-\nvidual cash flow and then sum the respective present values.

This equation will \nreappear when we value dividends from stocks because stocks have no predefined \nlife span. (A stock paying constant dividends is similar to a perpetuity.) With the first \npayment a year from now, a perpetuity of $10 per year with a 20 percent required \nrate of return has a present value of $10/0.2 = $50.\nEquation 13 is valid only for a perpetuity with level payments. In our development \nabove, the first payment occurred at t = 1; therefore, we compute the present value \nas of t = 0.\nOther assets also come close to satisfying the assumptions of a perpetuity. Certain \ngovernment bonds and preferred stocks are typical examples of financial assets that \nmake level payments for an indefinite period of time.\nEXAMPLE 14\nThe Present Value of a Perpetuity\n1. The British government once issued a type of security called a consol bond, \nwhich promised to pay a level cash flow indefinitely. If a consol bond paid \n\u00a3100 per year in perpetuity, what would it be worth today if the required \nrate of return were 5 percent?\nSolution:\nTo answer this question, we can use Equation 13 with the following data:\n \nA = \u00a3100\n  \nr = 5 %  = 0.05\n  \n \nPV = A\u200a/\u200ar  \n= \u00a3100\u200a/\u200a0.05\n  \n \n= \u00a32, 000\n \n \nThe bond would be worth \u00a32,000.\n10\n\nPresent Value of a Perpetuity\n27\nPresent Values Indexed at Times Other than t = 0\nIn practice with investments, analysts frequently need to find present values indexed \nat times other than t = 0. Subscripting the present value and evaluating a perpetuity \nbeginning with $100 payments in Year 2, we find PV1 = $100/0.05 = $2,000 at a 5 percent \ndiscount rate. Further, we can calculate today\u2019s PV as PV0 = $2,000/1.05 = $1,904.76.\nConsider a similar situation in which cash flows of $6 per year begin at the end \nof the 4th year and continue at the end of each year thereafter, with the last cash \nflow at the end of the 10th year. From the perspective of the end of the third year, \nwe are facing a typical seven-year ordinary annuity. We can find the present value of \nthe annuity from the perspective of the end of the third year and then discount that \npresent value back to the present. At an interest rate of 5 percent, the cash flows of \n$6 per year starting at the end of the fourth year will be worth $34.72 at the end of \nthe third year (t = 3) and $29.99 today (t = 0).\nThe next example illustrates the important concept that an annuity or perpetuity \nbeginning sometime in the future can be expressed in present value terms one period \nprior to the first payment. That present value can then be discounted back to today\u2019s \npresent value.\nEXAMPLE 15\nThe Present Value of a Projected Perpetuity\n1. Consider a level perpetuity of \u00a3100 per year with its first payment beginning \nat t = 5. What is its present value today (at t = 0), given a 5 percent discount \nrate?\nSolution:\nFirst, we find the present value of the perpetuity at t = 4 and then discount \nthat amount back to t = 0. (Recall that a perpetuity or an ordinary annuity \nhas its first payment one period away, explaining the t = 4 index for our \npresent value calculation.)\ni. \nFind the present value of the perpetuity at t = 4:\n \nA = \u00a3100\n  \nr = 5 %  = 0.05\n  \n \nPV = A / r  \n= \u00a3100 / 0.05\n  \n= \u00a32, 000\n \n \nii. \nFind the present value of the future amount at t = 4.

Suppose we own a perpetuity. At the same time, we \nissue a perpetuity obligating us to make payments; these payments are the same size \nas those of the perpetuity we own. However, the first payment of the perpetuity we \nissue is at t = 5; payments then continue on forever.

You are interested in determining how long it will take an investment of \nEUR10,000,000 to double in value. The current interest rate is 7 percent com-\npounded annually. How many years will it take EUR10,000,000 to double to \nEUR20,000,000?\nSolution:\nUse Equation 2, FVN = PV(1 + r)N, to solve for the number of periods, N, as \nfollows:\n \n ( 1 + r ) N =  FV N \u200a/\u200aPV = 2\n  \n \n \nN ln  ( 1 + r )  = ln  ( 2 )    \n \nN = ln  ( 2 )  \u200a/\u200aln  ( 1 + r )    \n \n= ln  ( 2 )  \u200a/\u200aln  ( 1.07 )  = 10.24\n  \nWith an interest rate of 7 percent, it will take approximately 10 years for the \ninitial EUR10,000,000 investment to grow to EUR20,000,000. Solving for N in the \nexpression (1.07)N = 2.0 requires taking the natural logarithm of both sides \nand using the rule that ln(xN) = N ln(x). Generally, we find that N = [ln(FV/\nPV)]/ln(1 + r). Here, N = ln(EUR20,000,000/EUR10,000,000)/ln(1.07) = ln(2)/\nln(1.07) = 10.24.9\nSOLVING FOR SIZE OF ANNUITY PAYMENTS\ncalculate and interpret the future value (FV) and present value (PV) \nof a single sum of money, an ordinary annuity, an annuity due, a \nperpetuity (PV only), and a series of unequal cash flows\ndemonstrate the use of a time line in modeling and solving time \nvalue of money problems\nIn this section, we discuss how to solve for annuity payments.

You are planning to purchase a $120,000 house by making a down payment \nof $20,000 and borrowing the remainder with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage \nwith monthly payments. The first payment is due at t = 1. Current mortgage \ninterest rates are quoted at 8 percent with monthly compounding. What will \nyour monthly mortgage payments be?\nSolution:\nThe bank will determine the mortgage payments such that at the stated \nperiodic interest rate, the present value of the payments will be equal to the \namount borrowed (in this case, $100,000). With this fact in mind, we can \nuse Equation 11,  PV = A  \n[\n \n1 -  \n1 \n_ \n ( 1 + r ) N    \n_ \nr \n \n]\n  , to solve for the annuity amount, A, \nas the present value divided by the present value annuity factor:\n \nPV = $100, 000\n  \n \n r s = 8 %  = 0.08\n  \n \nm = 12\n  \n r s \u200a/\u200am = 0.08\u200a/\u200a12 = 0.006667\n  \n \n \nN = 30\n  \nmN = 12 \u00d7 30 = 360\n  \n \nPresent value annuity factor =  \n1 -  \n1 \n____________ \n \n [ 1 +   ( r s \u200a/\u200am )  ] \nmN \n   \n \n_____________ \n r s \u200a/\u200am \n =  \n1 -  \n1 \n_ \n ( 1.006667 ) 360    \n \n____________ \n0.006667 \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n= 136.283494\n  \n \nA = PV\u200a/\u200aPresent value annuity factor\n  \n \n \n \n= $100, 000\u200a/\u200a136.283494\n  \n \n= $733.76\n \n \nThe amount borrowed, $100,000, is equivalent to 360 monthly payments of \n$733.76 with a stated interest rate of 8 percent. The mortgage problem is a \nrelatively straightforward application of finding a level annuity payment.\nNext, we turn to a retirement-planning problem. This problem illustrates the \ncomplexity of the situation in which an individual wants to retire with a specified \nretirement income. Over the course of a life cycle, the individual may be able to save \nonly a small amount during the early years but then may have the financial resources \nto save more during later years. Savings plans often involve uneven cash flows, a topic \nwe will examine in the last part of this reading. When dealing with uneven cash flows, \nwe take maximum advantage of the principle that dollar amounts indexed at the same \npoint in time are additive\u2014the cash flow additivity principle.\n\nLearning Module 1 \nThe Time Value of Money\n34\nEXAMPLE 21\nThe Projected Annuity Amount Needed to Fund a \nFuture-Annuity Inflow\n1. Jill Grant is 22 years old (at t = 0) and is planning for her retirement at age \n63 (at t = 41). She plans to save $2,000 per year for the next 15 years (t = 1 \nto t = 15). She wants to have retirement income of $100,000 per year for 20 \nyears, with the first retirement payment starting at t = 41. How much must \nGrant save each year from t = 16 to t = 40 in order to achieve her retirement \ngoal? Assume she plans to invest in a diversified stock-and-bond mutual \nfund that will earn 8 percent per year on average.\nSolution:\nTo help solve this problem, we set up the information on a time line. As \nExhibit 12 shows, Grant will save $2,000 (an outflow) each year for Years \n1 to 15. Starting in Year 41, Grant will start to draw retirement income of \n$100,000 per year for 20 years. In the time line, the annual savings is record-\ned in parentheses ($2) to show that it is an outflow. The problem is to find \nthe savings, recorded as X, from Year 16 to Year 40.\n \nExhibit 12: Solving for Missing Annuity Payments (in Thousands) \n \n |\n |\n |       |\n |\n |    \n   |\n |  \n  |    \n    |\n 0\n 1\n 2\n15\n16\n17\n40\n41\n42 \n60\n    ($2)      ($2)  ... ($2)      (X)       (X)  ...  (X)\n$100\n$100 ... $100\n...\n...\n...\nSolving this problem involves satisfying the following relationship: the pres-\nent value of savings (outflows) equals the present value of retirement income \n(inflows). We could bring all the dollar amounts to t = 40 or to t = 15 and \nsolve for X.\nLet us evaluate all dollar amounts at t = 15 (we encourage the reader to \nrepeat the problem by bringing all cash flows to t = 40). As of t = 15, the \nfirst payment of X will be one period away (at t = 16). Thus we can value the \nstream of Xs using the formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity.\nThis problem involves three series of level cash flows. The basic idea is that \nthe present value of the retirement income must equal the present value of \nGrant\u2019s savings. Our strategy requires the following steps:\n1. Find the future value of the savings of $2,000 per year and index it at t \n= 15. This value tells us how much Grant will have saved.\n2. Find the present value of the retirement income at t = 15. This value \ntells us how much Grant needs to meet her retirement goals (as of t \n= 15). Two substeps are necessary. First, calculate the present value \nof the annuity of $100,000 per year at t = 40. Use the formula for the \npresent value of an annuity. (Note that the present value is indexed at t \n= 40 because the first payment is at t = 41.) Next, discount the present \nvalue back to t = 15 (a total of 25 periods).\n\nSolving for Size of Annuity Payments\n35\n3. Now compute the difference between the amount Grant has saved \n(Step 1) and the amount she needs to meet her retirement goals (Step \n2). Her savings from t = 16 to t = 40 must have a present value equal to \nthe difference between the future value of her savings and the present \nvalue of her retirement income.\nOur goal is to determine the amount Grant should save in each of the 25 \nyears from t = 16 to t = 40. We start by bringing the $2,000 savings to t = 15, \nas follows:\n \nA = $2, 000\n  \n \nr = 8 %  = 0.08\n  \n \nN = 15\n  \nFV = A  [  ( 1 + r ) N - 1 \n_ \nr \n ]    \n \n= $2, 000  [  ( 1.08 ) 15 - 1 \n_ \n0.08 \n ]  \n  \n \n= $2, 000  ( 27.152114 )  \n  \n \n= $54, 304.23\n \n \nAt t = 15, Grant\u2019s initial savings will have grown to $54,304.23.\nNow we need to know the value of Grant\u2019s retirement income at t = 15. As \nstated earlier, computing the retirement present value requires two sub-\nsteps. First, find the present value at t = 40 with the formula in Equation \n11; second, discount this present value back to t = 15. Now we can find the \nretirement income present value at t = 40:\n \nA = $100, 000\n  \n \nr = 8 %  = 0.08\n  \n \nN = 20\n  \nPV = A  [ \n1 -  \n1 \n_ \n ( 1 + r ) N    \n_ \nr \n ]  \n  \n \n= $100, 000  [ \n1 -  \n1 \n_ \n ( 1.08 ) 20    \n_ \n0.08 \n ]  \n  \n \n \n= $100, 000  ( 9.818147 )  \n  \n \n= $981, 814.74\n \n \nThe present value amount is as of t = 40, so we must now discount it back as \na lump sum to t = 15:\n \n FV N = $981, 814.74\n  \n \nN = 25\n  \nr = 8 %  = 0.08\n  \n \nPV =  FV N  ( 1 + r ) -N   \n \n= $981, 814.74  ( 1.08 ) -25 \n  \n \n= $981, 814.74  ( 0.146018 )  \n  \n \n \n= $143, 362.53\n \n \nNow recall that Grant will have saved $54,304.23 by t = 15. Therefore, \nin present value terms, the annuity from t = 16 to t = 40 must equal the \ndifference between the amount already saved ($54,304.23) and the amount \nrequired for retirement ($143,362.53). This amount is equal to $143,362.53 - \n$54,304.23 = $89,058.30. Therefore, we must now find the annuity payment, \nA, from t = 16 to t = 40 that has a present value of $89,058.30. We find the \nannuity payment as follows:\n\nLearning Module 1 \nThe Time Value of Money\n36\n \nPV = $89, 058.30\n  \n \nr = 8 %  = 0.08\n  \n \nN = 25\n  \nPresent value annuity factor =   [ \n1 -  \n1 \n_ \n ( 1 + r ) N    \n_ \nr \n ]  \n  \n \n \n \n=   [ \n1 -  \n1 \n_ \n ( 1.08 ) 25    \n_ \n0.08 \n ]  \n  \n \n= 10.674776\n  \n \nA = PV\u200a/\u200aPresent value annuity factor\n  \n \n \n \n= $89, 058.30\u200a/\u200a10.674776\n  \n \n \n= $8, 342.87\n \n \nGrant will need to increase her savings to $8,342.87 per year from t = 16 to t \n= 40 to meet her retirement goal of having a fund equal to $981,814.74 after \nmaking her last payment at t = 40.\nPRESENT AND FUTURE VALUE EQUIVALENCE AND \nTHE ADDITIVITY PRINCIPLE\ncalculate and interpret the future value (FV) and present value (PV) \nof a single sum of money, an ordinary annuity, an annuity due, a \nperpetuity (PV only), and a series of unequal cash flows\ndemonstrate the use of a time line in modeling and solving time \nvalue of money problems\nAs we have demonstrated, finding present and future values involves moving amounts \nof money to different points on a time line. These operations are possible because \npresent value and future value are equivalent measures separated in time. Exhibit 13 \nillustrates this equivalence; it lists the timing of five cash flows, their present values \nat t = 0, and their future values at t = 5.\nTo interpret Exhibit 13, start with the third column, which shows the present val-\nues. Note that each $1,000 cash payment is discounted back the appropriate number \nof periods to find the present value at t = 0. The present value of $4,329.48 is exactly \nequivalent to the series of cash flows. This information illustrates an important point: \nA lump sum can actually generate an annuity. If we place a lump sum in an account \nthat earns the stated interest rate for all periods, we can generate an annuity that is \nequivalent to the lump sum. Amortized loans, such as mortgages and car loans, are \nexamples of this principle.\nExhibit 13: The Equivalence of Present and Future Values\nTime\nCash Flow ($)\nPresent Value at t = 0\n\u00a0\nFuture Value at t = 5\n1\n1,000\n$1,000(1.05)-1\n=\n$952.38\n\u00a0\n$1,000(1.05)4\n=\n$1,215.51\n2\n1,000\n$1,000(1.05)-2\n=\n$907.03\n\u00a0\n$1,000(1.05)3\n=\n$1,157.63\n3\n1,000\n$1,000(1.05)-3\n=\n$863.84\n\u00a0\n$1,000(1.05)2\n=\n$1,102.50\n13\n\n",

These operations are possible because \npresent value and future value are equivalent measures separated in time. Exhibit 13 \nillustrates this equivalence; it lists the timing of five cash flows, their present values \nat t = 0, and their future values at t = 5.\nTo interpret Exhibit 13, start with the third column, which shows the present val-\nues. Note that each $1,000 cash payment is discounted back the appropriate number \nof periods to find the present value at t = 0. The present value of $4,329.48 is exactly \nequivalent to the series of cash flows. This information illustrates an important point: \nA lump sum can actually generate an annuity. If we place a lump sum in an account \nthat earns the stated interest rate for all periods, we can generate an annuity that is \nequivalent to the lump sum. Amortized loans, such as mortgages and car loans, are \nexamples of this principle.\nExhibit 13: The Equivalence of Present and Future Values\nTime\nCash Flow ($)\nPresent Value at t = 0\n\u00a0\nFuture Value at t = 5\n1\n1,000\n$1,000(1.05)-1\n=\n$952.38\n\u00a0\n$1,000(1.05)4\n=\n$1,215.51\n2\n1,000\n$1,000(1.05)-2\n=\n$907.03\n\u00a0\n$1,000(1.05)3\n=\n$1,157.63\n3\n1,000\n$1,000(1.05)-3\n=\n$863.84\n\u00a0\n$1,000(1.05)2\n=\n$1,102.50\n13\n\nPresent and Future Value Equivalence and the Additivity Principle\n37\nTime\nCash Flow ($)\nPresent Value at t = 0\n\u00a0\nFuture Value at t = 5\n4\n1,000\n$1,000(1.05)-4\n=\n$822.70\n\u00a0\n$1,000(1.05)1\n=\n$1,050.00\n5\n1,000\n$1,000(1.05)-5\n=\n$783.53\n\u00a0\n$1,000(1.05)0\n=\n$1,000.00\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSum:\n\u00a0\n$4,329.48\n\u00a0\nSum:\n\u00a0\n$5,525.64\nTo see how a lump sum can fund an annuity, assume that we place $4,329.48 in the \nbank today at 5 percent interest. We can calculate the size of the annuity payments \nby using Equation 11. Solving for A, we find\n \nA =  \nPV \n___________ \n \n 1 -   [ 1\u200a/\u200a ( 1 + r ) N ]   \n \n____________ \nr \n \n  \n  \n \n=  $4, 329.48 \n_ \n 1 -   [ 1\u200a/\u200a ( 1.05 ) 5 ]   \n \n____________ \n0.05 \n     \n \n= $1, 000\n \n \nExhibit 14 shows how the initial investment of $4,329.48 can actually generate five \n$1,000 withdrawals over the next five years.\nTo interpret Exhibit 14, start with an initial present value of $4,329.48 at t = 0. \nFrom t = 0 to t = 1, the initial investment earns 5 percent interest, generating a future \nvalue of $4,329.48(1.05) = $4,545.95. We then withdraw $1,000 from our account, \nleaving $4,545.95 - $1,000 = $3,545.95 (the figure reported in the last column for time \nperiod 1). In the next period, we earn one year\u2019s worth of interest and then make a \n$1,000 withdrawal. After the fourth withdrawal, we have $952.38, which earns 5 per-\ncent. This amount then grows to $1,000 during the year, just enough for us to make \nthe last withdrawal. Thus the initial present value, when invested at 5 percent for five \nyears, generates the $1,000 five-year ordinary annuity. The present value of the initial \ninvestment is exactly equivalent to the annuity.\nNow we can look at how future value relates to annuities. In Exhibit 13, we \nreported that the future value of the annuity was $5,525.64. We arrived at this figure \nby compounding the first $1,000 payment forward four periods, the second $1,000 \nforward three periods, and so on. We then added the five future amounts at t = 5. \nThe annuity is equivalent to $5,525.64 at t = 5 and $4,329.48 at t = 0. These two dollar \nmeasures are thus equivalent. We can verify the equivalence by finding the present \nvalue of $5,525.64, which is $5,525.64 \u00d7 (1.05)-5 = $4,329.48. We found this result \nabove when we showed that a lump sum can generate an annuity.\nExhibit 14: How an Initial Present Value Funds an Annuity\nTime \nPeriod\nAmount Available \nat the Beginning of \nthe Time Period ($)\nEnding Amount before Withdrawal\nWithdrawal ($)\nAmount Available \nafter Withdrawal ($)\n1\n4,329.48\n$4,329.48(1.05)\n=\n$4,545.95\n1,000\n3,545.95\n2\n3,545.95\n$3,545.95(1.05)\n=\n$3,723.25\n1,000\n2,723.25\n3\n2,723.25\n$2,723.25(1.05)\n=\n$2,859.41\n1,000\n1,859.41\n4\n1,859.41\n$1,859.41(1.05)\n=\n$1,952.38\n1,000\n952.38\n5\n952.38\n$952.38(1.05)\n=\n$1,000\n1,000\n0\nTo summarize what we have learned so far: A lump sum can be seen as equivalent to \nan annuity, and an annuity can be seen as equivalent to its future value. Thus present \nvalues, future values, and a series of cash flows can all be considered equivalent as \nlong as they are indexed at the same point in time.\n\nLearning Module 1 \nThe Time Value of Money\n38\nThe Cash Flow Additivity Principle\nThe cash flow additivity principle\u2014the idea that amounts of money indexed at the \nsame point in time are additive\u2014is one of the most important concepts in time value of \nmoney mathematics. We have already mentioned and used this principle; this section \nprovides a reference example for it.\nConsider the two series of cash flows shown on the time line in Exhibit 15. The \nseries are denoted A and B. If we assume that the annual interest rate is 2 percent, \nwe can find the future value of each series of cash flows as follows. Series A\u2019s future \nvalue is $100(1.02) + $100 = $202. Series B\u2019s future value is $200(1.02) + $200 = $404. \nThe future value of (A + B) is $202 + $404 = $606 by the method we have used up \nto this point. The alternative way to find the future value is to add the cash flows of \neach series, A and B (call it A + B), and then find the future value of the combined \ncash flow, as shown in Exhibit 15.\nThe third time line in Exhibit 15 shows the combined series of cash flows. Series \nA has a cash flow of $100 at t = 1, and Series B has a cash flow of $200 at t = 1. The \ncombined series thus has a cash flow of $300 at t = 1. We can similarly calculate the \ncash flow of the combined series at t = 2. The future value of the combined series \n(A + B) is $300(1.02) + $300 = $606\u2014the same result we found when we added the \nfuture values of each series.\nThe additivity and equivalence principles also appear in another common situa-\ntion. Suppose cash flows are $4 at the end of the first year and $24 (actually separate \npayments of $4 and $20) at the end of the second year. Rather than finding present \nvalues of the first year\u2019s $4 and the second year\u2019s $24, we can treat this situation as a \n$4 annuity for two years and a second-year $20 lump sum. If the discount rate were \n6 percent, the $4 annuity would have a present value of $7.33 and the $20 lump sum \na present value of $17.80, for a total of $25.13.\nExhibit 15: The Additivity of Two Series of Cash Flows\nt = 0\nt = 1\nt = 2\nA\n$100\n$100\nt = 0\nt = 1\nt = 2\nB\n$200\n$200\nt = 0\nt = 1\nt = 2\nA + B\n$300\n$300\n\n",

The difference between the interest rate on Investment 2 and \nInvestment 1 is 0.5 percentage point. This amount represents the liquidity \npremium, which represents compensation for the risk of loss relative to \nan investment\u2019s fair value if the investment needs to be converted to cash \nquickly.\nB. To estimate the default risk premium, find the two investments that have the \nsame maturity but different levels of default risk. Both Investments 4 and 5 \nhave a maturity of eight years. Investment 5, however, has low liquidity and \nthus bears a liquidity premium. The difference between the interest rates of \nInvestments 5 and 4 is 2.5 percentage points. The liquidity premium is 0.5 \npercentage point (from Part A). This leaves 2.5 - 0.5 = 2.0 percentage points \nthat must represent a default risk premium reflecting Investment 5\u2019s high \ndefault risk.\nC. Investment 3 has liquidity risk and default risk comparable to Investment \n2, but with its longer time to maturity, Investment 3 should have a higher \nmaturity premium. The interest rate on Investment 3, r3, should thus be \nabove 2.5 percent (the interest rate on Investment 2). If the liquidity of \nInvestment 3 were high, Investment 3 would match Investment 4 except for \nInvestment 3\u2019s shorter maturity. We would then conclude that Investment \n3\u2019s interest rate should be less than the interest rate on Investment 4, which \nis 4 percent. In contrast to Investment 4, however, Investment 3 has low \nliquidity. It is possible that the interest rate on Investment 3 exceeds that of \nInvestment 4 despite 3\u2019s shorter maturity, depending on the relative size of \nthe liquidity and maturity premiums. However, we expect r3 to be less than \n4.5 percent, the expected interest rate on Investment 4 if it had low liquidity. \nThus 2.5 percent < r3 < 4.5 percent.\n2. C is correct. The sum of the real risk-free interest rate and the inflation premium \nis the nominal risk-free rate.\n3. C is correct.
